			<p>UBU Today's mission and vision is to increase awareness, educate and offer untraditional and holistic avenues to restore vitality and manage autoimmune diseases in the United States.   

			Extended exposure to stress and unresolved blockages stemming from experiences of helplessness lead to autoimmune diseases NOT treatable by traditional medicine (CDC - Center of Disease Control). </p>	 

			<p>UBU Today is committed to promoting, educating and offering modalities as a springboard for renewed hope, healing and vitality.  These modalities incorporate breathwork, therapeutic touch and sound, energetic bodywork and meditation.  
			De-armouring is essential for transformation and healing. Creating a safe container, fostering community and promoting individualism, organically de-armours and creates a safe space for "letting go" which ultimately leads to renewed hope, restoration and VITALITY. </p>


			<p>Connecting touch, vibration and breath to the body's pulsation consciously reconnects the heart and body creating a profound space for healing.   
			UBU Today provides holistic and alternative modalities that gently activate the physical, spiritual, and emotional planes and are each integral and interdependent for root-level whole-person paradigm restoration and transformation. 
			Facilitating the gentle completion of these organically interrupted reflexes, which stem from feelings of helplessness, restores the free flow of vital life energy to create space that makes you feel vitally alive! </p>

			<p>UBU Todayâ€™s workshops and individual sessions create physical, meditative and healing experiences that transform and connect the body's vital energy.   
			These sessions help to heal the body and assist in clearing blockages resulting in the free flow of vital energy.
			Offering these often intangible and transformational experiences in the U.S. is what makes UBU Today unique in the arena. </p>
