              <p>The customisation options you implemented are countless, and I feel sorry I can't use them all. Good job, and keep going!
              My experience during the Cocoon Massage Retreat was the most profound healing shift that I have yet to experience. It was everything that I have been looking for, and more. Within the first meditation during the retreat, I understood how authentic and dedicated the Cocoon Team was. They created a sacred space for everyone involved to go as deep as possible, and the safety that I felt during those days I still carry with me. I didn't know that it was possible to go on a healing journey with only my breath, and now the possibilities are endless with what I learned and discovered there. I was able to shed so many layers of trauma with these breathing techniques and massage work, and I still am feeling the benefits weeks later.
              <br>I understand that it's only the beginning and I look forward to many more retreats with my Cocoon family and to thank Jo Morris creating the opportunity to experience this beautiful work. I'm so grateful that I had this opportunity and <strong>my life is forever changed</strong> because of it.</p>

            <p>The stress of working in a fast-paced environment such as automotive manufacturing has made it difficult for me to breathe normally for a long time. However, after attending this retreat I am now able to catch a full breath of air with ease. In my whole life, I’ve never been able to release so much stress and anxiety. The environment that Jean-Paul creates for the group is one of unconditional love. In other words, total acceptance.It is this kind of environment that allows for deep healing work to manifest. Through guided exercises, I experienced rapid vibrations in different areas of my body that I was able to move up my spine to my neck and release muscle tension. I experienced tingling sensations in my hands and in my stomach. Everything around me felt like it was part of me when I touched it with my hands. I felt connected. I felt whole. I felt relieved.</p>

            <p>When Wendy talked with me about the Cocoon retreat, I was intrigued and said yes right away. Knowing her character, integrity, and passion for helping others allowed me to enter into the experience without a need to know exactly what was going to happen. I was aware that Wendy had experienced tremendous healing through the type of work she’s involved in—all the more reason to embrace the opportunity. My decision to show up, to trust the process, and to invest myself fully in it is truly three of the best decisions I’ve ever made.I was in need of healing myself. For the last 17 years, I’ve been dealing with a stress-driven thyroid conversion disorder that was difficult to diagnose, and even more difficult to treat. The main symptom that presented with this condition was a complete loss of vocal function. I was initially diagnosed with Spasmodic Dysphonia—a vocal disorder with no known cause and no known cure, and when I began researching the condition I discovered that like myself, most people who are affected by it have histories of severe stress. Through prayer, I was able to identify the true cause of the problem, and was able to recover thanks to finding a thyroid protocol that works for me. Still, I’ve had to be extremely careful not to overtax my body, and have had side effects to deal with—the most troublesome of which was an increased heart rate.When the retreat began, I was at a loss as to how the exercises we engaged in could have any real effect on me physically, mentally, or spiritually; however, I decided to disconnect from my rational mind and simply experience what was being offered. The more I let go and trusted the safe environment that was provided and the people around me, the more I was able to access things that felt like they had been buried deep within me for years. Alternately, I wept, laughed, screamed, and sobbed, yet what I was experiencing could not be tied to any three situation or circumstance. I didn’t need to know where it was coming from or why I felt that way, I just needed to release it—or more accurately, to let it be. Just when I felt there couldn’t possibly be anything else to deal with, waves of emotion would rise to the surface yet again. I was amazed that I could be that vulnerable in the presence of people I had never met before and that they in kind could share the deepest parts of themselves with me. The people I shared this experience with are like brothers and sisters to me, and I have a bond with them that defies explanation.Shortly after the retreat I saw my doctor for my six-month thyroid check and my heart rate was normal at that visit for the first time in over 5 years. Although I’ve always considered myself to be emotionally open, I am finding that I am connecting with people more easily—even total strangers. I have less mental and physical stress, and am more able to step back and take a deep breath in emotionally charged situations. The time I spend meditating is richer and when I pray, I am physically affected by my connection with God—it’s as if I’m plugged into the source of all life and love is pulsing throughout my body. I have been doing serious self-improvement/spiritual work for many years and nothing I have dthree has been as strong as this work. I believe that my life has been forever changed by this experience and I am so grateful that I was able to be a part of it.</p>

            <p>I want to first start out by saying that I wasn’t going to attend this retreat. It was a facebook event hosted by a company that I knew nothing about. However, the closer it got to the event, the more I saw it’s message pop up on Facebook. So, I finally looked into the event.The event was being held in the Midwest, in Michigan, close to my home. There were all types of indicators that I should attend. First the Facebook post kept popping up every time I was online.Next there was contact via facebook of another person in the area attending the workshop. He was in the Midwest. I finally called for more information on the number listed in the event. It was there that I first talked with Wendy Jo.From there a series of events took place..I started a new job in my field, of massage, it allowed me to be able to afford the retreat event. Next Wendy Jo explained that other quality professionals in my field would be in attendance including Jean Paul Lacroix and Julien Lacroix, both specialist in the field of healing as well as Shamanism. Wendy Jo and I communicated over the phone for the next few days as well as chat.I was undecided about attending the event right up until the week before. I decided by Wendy Jo’s persistence that it would be a life changing experience. Wendy said she couldn’t explain it but I wouldn’t be disappointed. The next several days I was contacted through staff and other attendees and briefly met for the first time on chat.Wendy felt overwhelmed but I assured her that she would be able to get enough attendees and then we would finally meet. I continued to seek other therapists to attend with me on short notice, but then Wendy Jo phthreed to say the class was full for attendees.I ventured away from my home state of Wisconsin and decided to drive the almost 5 hour adventure. It was so last minute so I looked at the email, threw together the items on the list and headed to Michigan. It had been almost 10 years since I went out of state for a workshop, especially on my own. For good measure, I took extra cash with me in case of emergencies, something I don’t always have on hand.Each step of my adventure was blessed with divine guidance. For example, I usually map out my drive before I embark on my journey. I did this. I decided to stop at the Wisconsin-Illinois border at the rest area to get a current Illinois map. This is when I mentithreed to the staff behind the counter that I was headed towards the Chicago bypass. The woman advised me to take an alternate route south, twenty minutes out of my way, but I’d avoid the congestion in Chicago due to the Stanley Cup winner and celebration for the Chiefs. So I took her instructions, my new map and detoured south. Turns out I have driven this road many times headed to Missouri for family reunions.As I headed towards Illinois 80, I realized that I would pass through Gary, Indiana as well as Michigan.So I drove Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan to get to retreat. A first for me so I took the time to stop along the way and enjoy the scenery. It delayed my arrival, but after all, I was on an adventure. So I eventually reached my retreat destination. I knew it was going to be great when I pulled up to Ronora and realized it was the perfect place for a retreat. Quiet, hidden, calm, peaceful. Little did I know that my journey was just beginning.</p><h4>~Arrival Day~</h4><p>I drove up to the lodge and located the house where we would be staying. It was two story with tons of rooms and apparently lots of new friends I needed to meet. I went inside and looked around and that’s where I met my first of many new friends. We introduced ourselves and chatted a bit and then gathered our things from the car to the house where we would be staying.Shortly thereafter, several other participants came in and we introduced ourselves and started to greet each other. There was time before we formally gathered and after we were “moved in”, I explored the rest of the grounds. There was a lake, a meditation house, other cabins, tennis courts, nature trails and my favorite the swing set. I couldn’t resist. I jumped into a swing and began to fly as high as I could. After a few minutes of release, my long car drive behind me, I stopped and looked up. I noticed the sticker on the swing that said “No adults allowed. No three over 300 lbs..Kids under 8 years” I chuckled as I realized I’d broken a rule at camp and I wasn’t even there for 30 minutes. I quietly stepped away from the swings and headed back to the house to meet up with the others. We then proceeded to the big hall for opening ceremonies.</p><h4>~Week of Learning~</h4><p>With each new day, I discovered more about my personal self. Issues that I had thought were dealt with were obviously hidden under the surface. With each new technique or breathing exercise or massage, my body and mind released more and more. Every day brought a new idea or thought process. Each day taught us how to be optimally well so we could work with our clients.I am open to new ideas and while some of the techniques forced me out of my comfort zthree, the entire experience truly changed my life. Wendy Jo was right. I’ve made some amazing new friends, learned more about myself, have learned new techniques of people management as well as self management. The retreat made me realize that there is still an entire world out there to explore and enjoy.The staff was top notch. They were very professional and the workshops always began on time. There was a reflection session each day and a sharing session if you chose to participate. Both were very beneficial because these sessions taught all of us how to communicate and how to listen better. We learned about trials and triumphs as well as ways to learn from our mistakes.The workshops were intense sessions and we learned much. They were organized and always were relevant to the lessons being taught. If there were questions, they were addressed efficiently and truthfully. The experience of sharing with others only made the retreat more impressive.The other attendees were also a great resource for the workshop. We all brought our individual talents and abilities to add to the retreat. Each of us had unique professions and contributed to the overall process of learning. We shared techniques, stories of personal growth and achievement as well as gaining friendships that last. We have also stayed in contact since the retreat since we are now a great support network for each other.I can truly say that Wendy Jo was correct. This was definitely a life changing adventure! Words can never truly express what this retreat has dthree for me both personally and professionally and I thank God everyday that He sent me to find all of them.I encourage you to attend our next retreat because it will be life changing and it will be a forever memory filled with compassion,fun, love, new ideas, great people and tons of new friends. Hope to see you there!</p>

              <span>French Translator, 1st Cocoon-US Retreat </span>
            </div>
              <p>My name is Christine Newton. I’m writing to share my story with you. It’s a little different from everyone else’s because I attended the workshop with the purpose of using my French language skills outside the classroom. This essentially was a job opportunity for me at a great location, West side of the state near the Lake Michigan. <br>Yah hoo! I kept calling for the translation job that was forwarded to me through French-American Chamber of Commerce but no reply.Finally when I had given up, I got the call from Wendy. She was worried about finding the right person for the translation position. It was not a typical 9 to 5 job. She wanted me to understand that it would be more of an intimate personal setting, where we were together during instruction time and meal times. I would translate as needed.As for my part, I had one concern, I ‘m a Christian and I didn’t want this to be some evil spirit thing.<br> Additionally, I had no background in massage healing but was willing to learn. Wendy assured me that everything would be in alignment with my faith and not to worry otherwise she wouldn't be promoting it.Once I felt I could accept the translation job, I packed and was on the road the next morning.Upon my arrival, I met with the members of the team, Wendy, Jean-Paul, Julian and Airgyro, and I was able to get settled in to my quarters. Then we reviewed the itinerary for each day.It was decided that all translations would be in the moment or live. Soon thereafter, the various participants trickled in then towards 5 o’clock we all sat in a circle and were able to make formal introductions and go over basic rules.This was a diverse group, ages 19-60’s. Most had had some experience with giving massage and or meditation. They were all open to learning and growing in this new technique. The team also established rules of safety such as: no picture taking, what is said here stays private. <br>If anyone was uncomfortable with anything, they just needed to say so and nothing was compulsory. Nothing sexual would be associated with healing massage, nor judging others or their reactions. The stage was set for a safe environment.To give a general picture of our week, most activities started off with the participants having to relax and shut off their thinking. I would translate the words of Jean-Paul as he guided the exercises. Background music was played.Besides being a translator, I had the privilege of being an observer and would notice the various degrees to which people were or were not able to let go. In one breathing exercise, I could witness participants working through their subconscious issues. A few were really arching their backs and crying and screaming out their pain. I remember thinking “ Wow, I never realized how much pain people carry inside, particularly victims of unresloved trauma.”I could "see" it on their outside appearances, but it was worse to see how deeply it was embedded in their bodies.As the exercises were practiced, the brokenness of the participants manifested itself in many different overt behaviors such as: fingers tight and frozen, shaking, running in place, various sounds coming from their mouths.Others went into expressing themselves as animals, such as a bird soaring, or crawling on the floor reconnecting with nature and their individual power.Others had unresolved childhood issues. <br>Jean-Paul would have me whisper positive words into their ears, such as “You are loved my daughter.”Others were encouraged to, "let go, stay with that feeling, you are doing well, yes, yes.....Then others were calm, placid, and smiling in happy places with arms letting loose in dance movements as if in a beautiful dream.After such exercises, we would go back into the circle and discuss what they felt after this particular activity.I would translate their testimonies into French for our French Cocoon team. It was their 1st time visit to the United States and we worked through some minor cultural barriers and connected at a soul level.Wendy experienced Cocoon in Greece and was guided to let others experience it in the United States.I was surprised how natural the live translation came to me as it felt strained when I attempted to pre-script.While translating some of the more difficult testimonies, I would fight to hold back my own tears. Hearing how a violent rape led a participant feeling as if they had lost control and power over their life. This hurt my heart to hear let alone translate to the group.Again, there was no judgment. The participants were like children and the safe space facilitated them to be vulnerable.<h4>~The Shift ~</h4>Through this process, I began to see the participants differently. I began to see them through their hearts. There was no judgment, fat, skinny, young or old.ALL of the body shapes and sizes were beautiful! No one was more or less than anyone else. Respect and love excuded the environment.Towards the 4th day, some began to notice that I was getting frustrated. I was watching this transformational process and witnessing the participants gain healing. Yet, I was not because of my position as the Translator.This is when Jean-Paul offered a healing Cocoon massage to me, if I wanted one.At this point, I knew I needed this, but I was afraid! What if I couldn’t relax my body enough? What if I farted or something? Worried and stuck "in my head". I’m such a thinker.After 28 years of teaching and two master’s degrees, it’s hard for me to stop thinking.On the last day, as the participants practiced on each other, I received a Cocoon healing massage from Jean-Paul.I rested myself with my eyes closed. As the massage began, I decided to just let things go where they went. Let go with no expectations.After some time, the breathing helped me get "out of my head". <br>I don’t know how long it was into the massage when very energtically driven things began to involuntarily occur. When certain parts of my body was touched, I could feel energy pulsing through my body. I had involuntary arm and hand flagellations, and I had a clear vision of a white flower field.As Jean-Paul pressed on kidney stone five, a pressure point located on the base of my foot, a great surge of energy came up my entire body as I screamed out releasing subconsciois emotional pain. My body had been holding this for who knows how long yet this molality reached it in less than two hours. I yelled as loud as I could and then held my yell for as far and long as I could until I could no more…. and then I 'let it go"….At another point, Jean–Paul was, holding and rocking me like he was my mom. I started to talk as if I was talking to her. I felt so much love from her and wanted to continue rocking. It was safe as in Cocoon.He also strategically placed my feet on ground and held them. Suddenly, I felt a sensation of being centered and fully grounded.Once my 2-hour massage was over, I transitioned out if it slowly. I felt so relaxed and content.<h4>Then something WONDERFUL happened:</h4>I couldn’t stop smiling.I was happy, genuinely gut-happy like a child.I felt as if the thicket and prickles of pain in my heart had been removed and now the space in there was smooth and no longer taken up by those feelings.I felt more energy and space to take in love or give love out. I had vision for things I want to do with my life in the near future.This is healing, not a"mind" thing at all. The breathwork, meditation, massage ams conscious touch principles are scientifically supported as effective alternative healing modalities.I am eager and excited, as this unanticipated, yet divenly scripted healing and liberating process continues.The alternative breathwork, massage, meditation and conscious touch modalities that Wendy Jo is avidly promoting as well as practicing personally are beyond words.Accepting this opportunity, required blind faith and a big leap. I will receive lifelong dividends from it. <br>Wendy exudes passion and gratitude while "Angels Secure the Perimeter"and miracles manifest.I pray that anyone who desires to participate in events coordinated by UBU TODAY that barriers are eliminated.I believe that God gave me this opportunity, as a gift for my own healing, because I was not seeking it at all.What was first taken as a "translation job opportunity" turned into a "life changing experience".This is just the beginning!
              <h4>B. T. W. It’s a month later and I am still smiling!</h4></p>

            <p>My name is Jimi Merk and I am a natural healing practitioner of many modalities with a focus in Shamanic healing techniques. I am a psychic medical intuitive as well as a medium. I have been working with people in holistic arts and medicine for over 12 years and have helped people all across America. I have a patin for helping people to Shine and started my wellness studio 9 years ago called Shine Your Light Wellness. I help all ages of clientele with all types of clinical and psychological issues. I help people to rehabilitate the body, mind, and spirit as well as teach my clients to heal themselves and others. I love to teach and travel the country continually teaching healing, intuitive ability development, spirituality, and astrophysics.<br>I was looking for something powerful to grow in my practice as well as to help others with when I found out about the Cocoon retreat and study in Michigan. It was through Wendy Jo, on Facebook, that I was given the opportunity to learn this unique combination of Dance movement work, powerful breathing Shamanic meditations, and nurturing with gentle Tantra healing massage. I love to Dance so the more movement and dancing the better as far as Im concerned. It is a wonderful way to connect to the body and your environment. The Dance helped us to place ourself in that vulnerable space to help with tearing down of walls of ego and to help people express through the creative self. Dance is fun and physical so it also helps release stress that is trapped in the body and gets the blood flowing.<br>The Deep breathing Kundalini meditation that we learned and experienced was perfect for forcing the release of emotional stress and pain. I have studied similar deep breathing meditations that are all very functional in pulling up emotional trauma and fear so that it can be released from the body, heart, and mind. This extensive meditation is unique because it involves holding space as well as pressure point and energy hands on healing techniques to assist in the healing journey of the participant. I loved how fast the response to the breathing and movement allowed for speedy release and healing. It was a very powerful experience and tremendously healing even for me as a seasoned practitioner and teacher. I connected with all of my guidance, animal spirits, and everything in the universe, It was a very powerful experience for me personally.<br>The Tantra massage was the perfect addition to this series as it was so incredibly nurturing and approached with a loving and gentle manner. After such movement with the dancing and the exhaustion of the deep rooted healing meditations this was exactly what our Bodies, hearts, and minds needed. By massaging we were squeezing out any remaining tension held in the body and allowing for better blood flow and rejuvenation. It was revealing as we were also nude while the massage was taking place which again allows us to let down ego and over protected boundaries that keep us from being comfortable with self. It also allows for ease of connection between practitioner and participant, both parties are vulnerable in the space and both hold respect and humility for each other. The tantra massage is wonderful las it is completed with lovely oils to aid in the healing and is done very slowly as to not disturb the mind and emotion as they are releasing more stress, fear, and pain. I absolutely loved this part of the retreat and study and have already enjoyed the healing power of the tantra massage with my clients and friends.<br>Overall Cocoon made an amazing 5 day workshop to experience with and learn. It will not only help me grow as a professional healing practitioner but will help me progress in my own personal practice permanently. I really appreciated my time with Jean Pauls team and look forward to learning more.<br>I feel that every practioner in the healing arts should experience this practice and the combination of modalities that are used!
