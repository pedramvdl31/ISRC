        Julie has had a lifelong interest in alternative healing modalities.  She is a proponent for natural birthing alternatives and attachment parenting.  In 1998, she was diagnosed with an incurable vocal disorder and began a quest to recover her voice.  She spent almost two years researching and trying various alternative treatments, but it was through grace that she discovered the true cause of the problem and was able to successfully treat it.  Since that time she has been involved in telling herrecovery story in order to help others find their voices.   After experiencing UBU Today modalities, she felt compelled to help bring this form of healing to others.
